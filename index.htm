        <h2>Build Climber and Train Stopper</h2>
        <p>I just finished this new routine.... it was isane! I did the routine with my body weight (I think around 80% of my max) and the intensity was very high! My first rep was about 2 minute and 10 second of hanging, my last was around 30 sec... insane! I add to my training regime by now! Thanks Lattice for all this cool stuffs, you help folks like me everyday.</p>
